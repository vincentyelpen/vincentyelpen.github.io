I hold a Bachelor's degree in Logistics Engineering and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. During my undergraduate studies, I gained a deep understanding of the core theories and practices in logistics engineering, including logistics system design, transportation management, warehousing, and distribution strategies. This solid engineering foundation sparked my keen interest in the field of logistics and supply chain management.

In Master's degree
======
In my graduate studies, I have broadened my perspective, focusing particularly on global supply chain management, supply chain strategy, and risk management. I am committed to integrating theory with practice, exploring innovative supply chain management methods to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize customer service levels.


Data analysis and decision support systems
======
I have a strong interest in data analysis and decision support systems and am proficient in various analytical tools and methods, such as supply chain modeling, optimization algorithms, and data-driven decision-making. Throughout my studies, I have actively participated in team projects, playing key roles in several projects where I successfully developed and implemented practical supply chain optimization solutions.

Data analysis
------
In the field of logistics and supply chain data analysis, I possess solid professional knowledge and extensive practical experience. I am proficient in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and I use data analysis tools (such as Python, SQL, Tableau, etc.) to optimize supply chain processes and improve operational efficiency. I am skilled at transforming complex data into actionable insights to support business decisions, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. In supply chain management, I am particularly adept at analysis related to demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and transportation network design, enabling me to accurately identify potential operational bottlenecks and provide practical improvement suggestions.

In addition, I have excellent communication skills, enabling me to collaborate with cross-functional teams and effectively convey data-driven analysis results to relevant stakeholders, facilitating the successful implementation of projects. I am dedicated to empowering the supply chain through data, creating greater value for the business.

Decision support systems
------
In the field of Decision Support Systems (DSS) for logistics and supply chain management, I possess deep expertise and practical experience. I specialize in designing and developing data-driven DSS to help companies optimize their supply chain management and operational processes. By integrating advanced algorithms, simulation models, and optimization techniques, I am able to build efficient DSS that enhance decision-making efficiency in areas such as inventory management, transportation optimization, and demand forecasting.

I am proficient in using various technical tools (such as SQL, Python, R, and specialized DSS software) to combine complex data analysis with business needs, providing customized solutions. My systems are capable of handling large volumes of real-time data and can assist companies in anticipating potential challenges and opportunities through predictive analytics and scenario simulations, enabling more forward-looking strategic decisions.

Additionally, I have excellent cross-functional communication skills, allowing me to work closely with both technical and business teams to ensure that the development and implementation of systems align with actual business needs and create tangible value for the company. I am committed to leveraging DSS applications to provide strong decision-making support for a company's logistics and supply chain management, driving sustained competitive advantage.

**In future**

In the future, I aspire to further develop my expertise in the field of logistics and supply chain management, continuously improving my professional skills through practice and research, and contributing to supply chain innovation and sustainable development in the industry.
